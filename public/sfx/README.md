# Sound effects

Add these short audio files (MP3, small file size) for in-app feedback:

- `click.mp3` – button / primary action
- `correct.mp3` – correct answer
- `wrong.mp3` – wrong answer
- `levelup.mp3` – level up
- `complete.mp3` – lesson or goal complete

If files are missing, the app still runs; sounds are simply skipped.
